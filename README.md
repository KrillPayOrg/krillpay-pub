KrillPay - A Fintech App

KrillPay is a cutting-edge fintech application built using React Native. It provides secure digital transactions, enabling users to create wallets, perform internal and cross-border payments, scan QR codes for payments, and manage crypto transactions. It also integrates KYC verification and utilizes JWT authentication for enhanced security. Additionally, KrillPay supports Plaid for seamless financial data aggregation and allows users to create business accounts for managing their financial operations.

🚀 Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure you have completed the React Native Environment Setup up to the "Creating a new application" step.

Step 1: Start the Metro Server

Metro is the JavaScript bundler that comes with React Native. To start Metro, run the following command from the root of your project:

# using npm

npm start

# OR using Yarn

yarn start

Step 2: Run the Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal in the project root and execute one of the following commands based on your target platform:

📱 Android

# using npm

npm run android

# OR using Yarn

yarn android

🍏 iOS

# using npm

npm run ios

# OR using Yarn

yarn ios

Once the setup is correct, you should see KrillPay running on your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator.

You can also run the app directly from Android Studio (for Android) and Xcode (for iOS).

✏️ Modifying Your App

Now that KrillPay is running, you can modify the application.

Open App.tsx in your preferred code editor and make changes.

To reflect changes instantly:

Android: Press R twice or select "Reload" from the Developer Menu (Ctrl + M on Windows/Linux, Cmd ⌘ + M on macOS).

iOS: Press Cmd ⌘ + R in the iOS Simulator.
